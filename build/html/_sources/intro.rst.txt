GEOG0133  TERRESTRIAL CARBON: MODELLING and MONITORING
=======================================================

Aims of the course
------------------

The Terrestrial Carbon: modelling and monitoring module aims:

* To outline the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle and the wider climate system
* To outline how the vegetation carbon cycle can be modelled and use the models in prediction
* To provide the linkages between the models and remote sensing observations (radiative transfer)
* To enable the students to use remote sensing (and other) data to constrain, test and criticise the models
* To expose the students to modern statistical methods in combining data and models

Content of the course
---------------------

The module will cover:

* The role of vegetation in the climate system
* Terrestrial vegetation dynamics modelling 
* Remote sensing of vegetation
* Radiation interactions with vegetation
* Model inversion in remote sensing
* Concepts and maths of data assimilation
* Using remote sensing data to constrain and test vegetation dynamics models

Assessment
----------

**"How well do we know global Net Primary Production?"**

Your answer should explain the processes that control these patterns and the uncertainties in our knowledge of these processes.


**Length and core requirements**

 

Your essay should be 3000 words or less (not including figure captions and references).


It should directly address the essay title and synthesise materials from reading around the subject of terrestrial carbon dynamics: modelling and monitoring, as well as course practicals and seminar materials.

It should demonstrate an understanding of core underlying theories, models and appropriate measurement methods and be able to express them simply and clearly.

**Topic area**

The essay should provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of knowledge on the topic. 

It should ideally use concepts from the main aspects of the course: basic theory, models, and measurement, and the integration of models and measurement.

**Essay style**

The essay should have a clear structure, and be based around material from multiple (>10) sources. 

Your essay should be a synthesis of information from multiple (>10) papers you have read and other sources. It should not simply be a list of information from a set of different papers or a regurgitation of course notes and figures. It should not simply be a re-hash of sections of IPCC report sections. A synthesis in this sense means bringing together material from multiple sources and presenting it in your own words and with your own critical analysis of the information. This means you should NOT be using large numbers of direct quotes or just paraphrasing slightly by changing a few words around. You must bring the information together and present it in your own words.

It should be based around the same focus as the course, i.e. terrestrial vegetation, rather than soils or atmospheric processes, although you may wish to touch upon such matters for context.

You must work individually on your submission. When using practical- and seminar-related items, these must be materials you have generated yourself (e.g. you can’t use a graph that another student has generated: you must use your own).

As for all coursework of this nature, to get a very high mark, you will be expected to show clear insight into the subject matter and make use of materials beyond the basics provided in the lectures.

Figures, citations and quotes
You must follow standard UCL procedures on citations, and fully attribute all materials used.

All figures and any quotes must be correctly captioned, giving the original source of any graphics used. Any quotes should have a page number associated with them, BUT you should not be using large numbers of direct quotes or long quotes in an essay of this nature.

Avoid citations of material as ‘geog0133 coursenotes’ and strictly avoid any quotation or figures from the course notes themselves.

You may develop your own figures, but make clear what they are based on (or where the information comes from).

The essay must be fully referenced. For reference to individual figures are other specific information from long or complex sources, make sure you include as page number.


Format of the course
--------------------

The module will be delivered through:

* Lectures (ppt summary, extensive web notes)
* Computer laboratory work (Python notebooks). 
* Student seminars

Learning outcomes
-----------------

At the end of the module, students should:

* Appreciate the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle and the climate system
* Appreciate the role, strengths and weaknesses of models of global vegetation processes
* Understand the factors affecting remote sensing measurements of vegetation (radiative transfer theory)
* Understand how to use models and observations in combination to improve estimates of carbon fluxes and pools 
* Have an understanding of data assimilation
